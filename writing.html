<h3>Major Delrish Moss</h3>
<p>Walking home from work when he was 15 years old, a police officer pushed him up against a wall, searched him, and walked away without an apology. From that moment, Major Delrish Moss knew he wanted to become a police officer so others would not have to be humiliated in that way. </P>
<p>Moss has been an officer with the Miami Police Department for 30 years. He started his time in the department as a uniform patrol officer driving in his childhood neighborhood, Overtown, a predominantly black neighborhood North of downtown. He worked the midnight patrol for almost three years. According to Moss, this assignment gave him a unique understanding of the problems that plagued Overtown's residents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="profile.html">See More >></a></p>
