<h3>Major Delrish Moss</h3>
<p>Walking home from work when he was 15 years old, a police officer pushed him up against a wall, searched him, and walked away without an apology. From that moment, Major Delrish Moss knew he wanted to become a police officer so others would not have to be humiliated in that way. </P>
<p>Moss has been an officer with the Miami Police Department for 30 years. He started his time in the department as a uniform patrol officer driving in his childhood neighborhood, Overtown, a predominantly black neighborhood North of downtown. He worked the midnight patrol for almost three years. According to Moss, this assignment gave him a unique understanding of the problems that plagued Overtown's residents.</p>
<p>The streets were filled with people he knew growing up and he was able to address domestic and drug abuse issues that may have gone without notice to another officer.</p> 
<p>"I was seen as a voice of authority," said Moss. "I was able to provide information and resources to help solve issues Iâ€™d witnessed for years."</p>
<p>After spending a year in the narcotics division dismantling drug organizations, Moss moved to the homicide unit. Moss said he found his work with homicide to be rewarding because he was able to bring closure to families. </p>
<p>"You are the person that has to tell someone that his or her loved one is never coming home," he said of his time in the homicide unit. However, it was also a rewarding position."There is some satisfaction in solving the mystery and bringing a person to justice."</p>
<p>Moss was at a mandatory training session when a former spokesman for the Miami Police Department, Bill Schwartz, asked if he had ever considered working for the Public Information Office. In 1996 Moss was appointed to the Public Information Office and was a spokesman and community liaison for the Miami Police Department for 16 years. Through the Public Information Office Moss influenced policy and people in Miami. In 2008, Moss was promoted to Commander of the Public Information Office and became the main spokesperson in regard to media for the Miami Police Department.</p>
<p>In 2011, Moss was promoted to Major and became commander of the Community Relations Section and Police Information Office.</p>
<p>"It is amazing to work for him," said Sergeant Freddie Cruz, Commander of the Public Information Office. "He empowers his employees to be creative and solve problems on their own."</p>
<p>As head of community relations, Moss emphasizes the importance of providing kids with positive influences and resources to become successful. He oversees several crime prevention programs such as the Police Athletic League.</p>
<p>"It is a crime prevention tool," he said of the Police Athletic League. "We want to pair kids with good influences and positive role models to keep them active and on the straight and narrow."</p>
<p>Another program Moss oversees is the Police Explorer program. The program allows middle school and high school students to go through a simulated police academy, dress in uniform, and volunteer under the supervision of police officers.</p>
<p>Another element of Moss' job is trying to prevent crime before it occurs by understanding the needs of neighborhoods. He employs community involvement specialists to convey the views of residents to the police department, in an effort to find issues in the community that may lead to crime. </p>
<p>"Crime is always the symptom of something larger," he said. "My job is to find solutions to the larger root problems."</p>
<p>According to Moss, finding solutions to problems is one of the most rewarding parts of being a police officer. </p>
<p>"You get to help people and solve mysteries everyday," he said. "That's what I find so rewarding about my job."</p>
