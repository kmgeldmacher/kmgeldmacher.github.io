<h3>South Miami Election</h3>
<p>Philip K. Stoddard was elected to his third term as mayor of South Miami on Tuesday in a landslide victory over opponents Valerie Newman and Rodney Williams.</p>
<p>Stoddard, a biology professor at Florida international University, received 1169 votes, followed by Newman, a women and South Miami city commissioner for the last five years, with 431 votes and Williams, the owner of a local hair salon, with 275 votes.</p> 
<p> "I feel pretty elated," said Stoddard in the commission chambers after the results were announced. "Not only did I win, I got people I can work with. People who share my values."</p>
<p>Stoddard said he was confident heading into the election. Dressed casually in khaki pants and short-sleeved button down shirt, Stoddard calmly mingled with supporters and voters outside city hall as the last few votes were cast. 
The scene outside City Hall was tense as both Stoddard and Newman supporters shouted profanities at each other across the parking lot. </p>
<p>"We are a colorful city with passionate people," said Beth Schwartz, a grassroots activist and spirited supporter of Stoddard. </P>
<p>Shortly before the polls closed, Williams rolled through the City Hall parking lot in a large, navy blue pick up truck with chrome wheels and a huge sound system in the open bed, blaring two songs by the O'Jays, "Give the People What they Want" and "The Back Stabbers."</p>
<p>Civility was one of the main issues in this election. Stoddard said he ran for reelection because he respects the citizens of South Miami. </p>
<p>"I've been a decent guy for the last four years," he said after the election.</p>
<p>In 2011, Newman was issued a letter by the Miami-Dade Commission on Ethics and Public Trust stating that her "rude, boorish, and tyrannical behavior" was inexcusable. She said that assertive, strong women are often called nasty adjectives.</p>
<p>"Yes, I am tenacious and passionate," she said before the election. "It is because I care about my city."
Another important issue for the candidates was finding a way to slow traffic through South Miami, which is often referred to as a cut-through town, as people travelling to and from work rush through the streets in an effort to avoid traffic. Both candidates support plans to make streets safer for South Miami residents. </p>
<p>As the candidates and supporters gathered in the commission chamber to hear the election results, Williams, dressed in khaki shorts and a t-shirt with his campaign logo printed on the chest, leaned against the back wall as Maria Menendez, the city clerk, announced the results. </p>
<p>"I don't believe I had the full support of the African American community," said Williams after the election results were announced. "Like a school of fish, they follow one leader and a lot of them followed Stoddard."</p>
<p>Williams said he probably won't run for mayor again but would like to run for a commissioner seat. 
Valerie Newman left before the results were announced and could not be reached for comment. </p>
<p>Two other seats on the five-member city commission were contested for by four candidates Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Walter Harris was reelected to one of the seats in a landslide against Horace Feliu, a former Mayor of South Miami. Harris, the new vice mayor, received 1096 votes, Feliu received 754. After the results were announced, Harris, dressed in a green Hawaiian shirt and bright orange baseball cap, stood and took a bow to the cheers of his supporters. </p>
<p>The last commission seat was filled by Gabriel Edmond, a government teacher at Southwest High School. </p>
<p>"As an educator with experience in government, I believe I have a skillset that will benefit the city and improve the commission," Edmond said. </p>
  <p>Edmond received 1059 votes, defeating his opponent Donna Shelley, who received 765 votes. Shelley lingered with several supporters in the parking lot after the results were announced.</p>
  <p>"I'm not happy," said Shelly. "I hope this commission can work together but the proof is in the pudding."</p>
  <p>Shelley said she would not run for office again.</p> 
  <p>The citizens of South Miami also voted on three resolutions Tuesday. They voted not to change the date of the election to coincide with federal elections in November.</p>
  <p>"It's a bad idea," Schwartz said. "We want people voting who care about local government. The local issues would get buried."</p>
  <p>They also voted against allowing a majority of the city commission to make emergency resolutions. The only resolution that was approved made several administrative changes to the City Charter.  </p>
  <p>One of the last people to leave City Hall Tuesday night was Gray Reed, the mayor's wife. Reed, a professor of architecture at Florida International University, left the city hall alone. She looked tired but relieved.</p>
  <p>"I think we have an honest and good commission now," she said. "It is such a change of mood. I hope we'll change the way people think about government."</p>
